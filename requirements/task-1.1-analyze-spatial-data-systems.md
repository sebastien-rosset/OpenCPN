# Task 1.1: Analyze Existing Spatial Data Systems

**Phase**: Foundation & Analysis  
**Dependencies**: None

## Detailed Description

Comprehensively analyze OpenCPN's multiple spatial data systems to understand the current landscape of geographic data sources and identify opportunities for unified spatial indexing.

## Data Systems to Analyze

- **GSHHS**: Current polygon-based coastline system with quality levels
- **S-57/ENC**: Vector chart format with depth contours, hazards, and navigation features
- **OSMSHP**: OpenStreetMap-derived shapefile coastline data
- **Shapefile basemaps**: Generic shapefile support for various geographic features
- **Chart databases**: Integration with existing chart data structures
- **Plugin data sources**: How plugins currently provide geographic data

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Data Format Assessment
- Understand each system's coordinate systems, projections, and datum handling
- Analyze polygon vs polyline representations across different sources
- Document feature classification schemes (land/water, depth levels, hazard types)
- Assess data quality, resolution, and coverage characteristics

### 2. Current Performance Characteristics
- Identify bottlenecks in existing polygon intersection algorithms
- Measure memory usage patterns for different data sources
- Analyze loading times and caching behaviors
- Document current spatial query patterns and frequencies

### 3. Integration Points Discovery
- Map existing APIs and data access patterns
- Identify common geometric operations across systems
- Understand plugin integration mechanisms
- Document existing coordinate transformation pipelines

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete inventory of all spatial data systems in OpenCPN
- [ ] Performance baseline measurements for each data source
- [ ] Documentation of data format characteristics and limitations
- [ ] Clear understanding of current plugin integration patterns
- [ ] Identified opportunities for unified spatial indexing across all systems
