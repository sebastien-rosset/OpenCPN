# Task 1.2: Design Multi-Source Spatial Feature Abstraction

**Phase**: Foundation & Analysis  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

## Detailed Description

Design a unified abstraction layer that can extract and represent spatial features from any available data source in a user's OpenCPN installation, enabling consistent spatial indexing regardless of the underlying data format.

## Abstraction Design Goals

### 1. Universal Feature Representation

- Design common feature types that can represent coastlines, depth contours, hazards, and navigation aids from any source
- Create abstraction for different geometry types (polygons, polylines, points) used across data systems
- Handle feature metadata and attributes consistently across different source formats
- Support hierarchical feature relationships (e.g., land/lake/island from GSHHS, chart object classes from S-57)

### 2. Dynamic Data Source Discovery

- Design system to automatically detect available spatial data sources in user installations
- Create priority and quality assessment framework for overlapping data sources
- Handle graceful degradation when preferred data sources are unavailable
- Support runtime addition of new data sources (e.g., user-installed charts or plugins)

### 3. Extensible Adapter Framework

- Design plugin-like architecture for data source adapters
- Create common interface for feature extraction from different formats
- Support streaming extraction for large datasets
- Handle coordinate system transformations and datum conversions uniformly

## Integration Considerations

- Build upon existing data loading patterns and caching mechanisms
- Maintain compatibility with current plugin APIs and data access methods
- Leverage existing coordinate transformation and geometric utility functions
- Ensure minimal impact on current chart loading and rendering performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unified feature representation that can handle all identified data sources
- [ ] Extensible adapter framework design that supports future data formats
- [ ] Dynamic data source discovery and prioritization strategy
- [ ] Clear integration path with existing OpenCPN data systems
- [ ] Performance model that doesn't degrade existing functionality
