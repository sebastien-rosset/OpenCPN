# Task 6.1: Performance Optimization and Benchmarking

**Phase**: Performance Optimization & Testing  
**Dependencies**: Task 4.2

## Detailed Description

Comprehensive performance optimization and benchmarking to ensure the system meets the 10-100x speedup goals and maintains excellent performance characteristics under various usage scenarios.

## Files to Create/Modify

- `test/performance_benchmark.cpp`
- `tools/spatial_index_profiler.cpp`
- Documentation: `docs/performance_analysis.md`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive Benchmarks
- Compare with original GSHHS implementation
- Test various geographic regions and complexities
- Measure memory usage and cache efficiency
- Profile multithreaded performance

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- CPU cache optimization for data structures
- SIMD acceleration for distance calculations
- Memory pool allocation for frequently used objects
- Prefetching strategies for predictable access patterns

### 3. Production Performance Monitoring
- Query time histograms
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance regression detection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Achieves >10x speedup for typical weather routing scenarios
- [ ] Memory usage <2x original GSHHS implementation
- [ ] Cache hit rate >90% for routing applications
- [ ] Multithreaded performance scales to 8+ cores
- [ ] Performance remains stable over long-running sessions
