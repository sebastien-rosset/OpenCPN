# Task 5.2: Implement Basic Route Finding

**Phase**: Advanced Features  
**Dependencies**: Task 5.1

## Detailed Description

Implement basic A* pathfinding using the spatial index to find safe routes between waypoints, demonstrating the routing capabilities enabled by the spatial indexing system.

## Files to Create/Modify

- `model/spatial/route_finder.h`
- `model/spatial/route_finder.cpp`
- `test/route_finder_test.cpp`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. A* Pathfinding Algorithm
- Use spatial index for obstacle detection
- Heuristic based on great circle distance
- Support for variable step sizes based on complexity

### 2. Route Optimization
- Smooth generated paths to reduce waypoints
- Optimize for minimum distance vs safety margin trade-offs
- Support for preferred route corridors

### 3. Edge Case Handling
- No valid path scenarios
- Very long routes (>1000nm)
- Complex archipelago navigation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Finds valid routes in <5 seconds for distances <500nm
- [ ] Generated routes avoid all land obstacles
- [ ] Route smoothing reduces waypoints by >50% while maintaining safety
- [ ] Handles island chains and narrow passages correctly
- [ ] Memory usage <100MB for complex route finding

## Pathfinding Algorithm Details

_This section will document the specific A* implementation, heuristics, and optimization techniques._

## Route Quality Metrics

_This section will define and measure route quality in terms of safety, efficiency, and navigability._
