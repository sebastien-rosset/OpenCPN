# Task 2.1: Implement Production Spatial Index

**Phase**: R-tree Implementation  
**Dependencies**: Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

## Detailed Description

Build a production-ready spatial indexing system based on insights from the prototype, supporting efficient queries across all available spatial data sources in OpenCPN.

## Core Spatial Index Requirements

### 1. High-Performance Spatial Data Structure
- Implement optimized spatial indexing algorithm (R-tree, quad-tree, or hybrid approach based on prototype results)
- Support efficient range queries, point queries, and line intersection tests
- Handle large datasets with millions of geographic features
- Optimize memory layout for cache efficiency and reduced memory usage

### 2. Multi-Resolution and Adaptive Indexing
- Support different index resolutions based on geographic area importance and query patterns
- Implement on-demand index building for areas as they are accessed
- Cache frequently accessed spatial regions with persistent storage
- Balance between index build time and query performance

### 3. Thread-Safe Concurrent Access
- Support multiple simultaneous spatial queries for routing and navigation
- Enable background index building without blocking navigation functions
- Handle concurrent data source updates (e.g., chart updates, new data installations)

## Integration with OpenCPN Systems

- Seamlessly integrate with existing chart loading and caching systems
- Maintain compatibility with current plugin APIs while enabling enhanced functionality
- Leverage existing coordinate transformation and geometric utility functions
- Support incremental updates as new charts or data sources are installed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Spatial index handles all available data sources in typical OpenCPN installation
- [ ] Query performance shows significant improvement over current implementations
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable for resource-constrained systems
- [ ] Thread-safe operation supports concurrent navigation and routing tasks
- [ ] Robust handling of data source updates and dynamic chart loading
