# Task 3.2: Develop Intelligent Caching and Prediction System

**Phase**: Distance Field Implementation  
**Dependencies**: Task 3.1

## Detailed Description

Create an intelligent caching system that automatically optimizes spatial index and distance field performance based on user navigation patterns and predicted usage scenarios.

## Intelligent Caching System Goals

### 1. Usage Pattern Learning
- Analyze historical routing and navigation queries to identify frequently accessed areas
- Predict future spatial query patterns based on planned routes and user behavior
- Adapt caching strategies based on different usage contexts (coastal navigation, ocean passages, harbor approaches)
- Support seasonal and regional usage pattern variations

### 2. Proactive Performance Optimization
- Pre-compute spatial indices and distance fields for predicted high-usage areas
- Implement background processing that doesn't interfere with navigation tasks
- Optimize memory allocation based on available system resources and usage patterns
- Coordinate with existing OpenCPN caching systems for chart and weather data

### 3. Dynamic Resource Management
- Balance between spatial index memory usage and query performance
- Implement graceful degradation strategies for resource-constrained systems
- Support user-configurable performance vs memory trade-offs
- Handle dynamic chart updates and new data source installations

## Integration with Navigation Workflows

- Seamlessly integrate with weather routing plugins and autopilot systems
- Support bulk query optimization for route planning applications
- Provide performance hints and recommendations for optimal navigation planning
- Enable real-time performance monitoring and adjustment

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Caching system learns and adapts to user navigation patterns
- [ ] Proactive optimization improves performance for predicted usage scenarios
- [ ] Resource management balances performance and memory usage effectively
- [ ] Integration enhances rather than disrupts existing navigation workflows
- [ ] System provides measurable performance improvements in real-world usage
