# Task 6.2: Comprehensive Integration Testing

**Phase**: Performance Optimization & Testing  
**Dependencies**: All previous tasks

## Detailed Description

Create comprehensive integration tests to ensure the spatial index works correctly with all OpenCPN components and typical usage patterns, validating the complete system in real-world scenarios.

## Files to Create/Modify

- `test/integration_test_suite.cpp`
- `test/weather_routing_integration_test.cpp`
- `test/regression_test_suite.cpp`

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Weather Routing Integration
- Verify speedup in real weather routing scenarios
- Test with various vessel types and constraints
- Ensure accuracy matches original implementation

### 2. Plugin Compatibility
- Verify existing plugins continue to work
- Test with popular navigation plugins
- Ensure API changes don't break existing functionality

### 3. Regression Test Suite
- Test with historical problem cases
- Verify edge cases are handled correctly
- Ensure performance doesn't regress over time

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Weather routing shows measurable speedup
- [ ] No crashes or memory leaks in extended testing
- [ ] Plugin compatibility verified with major navigation plugins
- [ ] System handles all typical OpenCPN usage scenarios correctly
