# Task 2.2: Develop Multi-Source Data Adapters

**Phase**: R-tree Implementation  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.1

## Detailed Description

Create a comprehensive set of data source adapters that can extract spatial features from all supported OpenCPN data formats, enabling unified spatial indexing regardless of the user's chart and data configuration.

## Data Source Adapter Development

### 1. GSHHS Coastline Adapter
- Extract polygon and polyline features from existing GSHHS quality levels
- Preserve hierarchical relationships (land/lake/island/pond)
- Maintain integration with existing GSHHS loading and caching mechanisms
- Support quality-based feature prioritization

### 2. S-57/ENC Chart Adapter
- Extract depth contours, soundings, and hazard information from vector charts
- Handle different S-57 object classes (DEPCNT, DEPARE, SOUNDG, OBSTRN, etc.)
- Support coordinate system transformations and datum conversions
- Manage feature updates as charts are updated or added

### 3. OSMSHP Shapefile Adapter
- Process OpenStreetMap-derived coastline shapefiles
- Handle large shapefile datasets efficiently
- Coordinate with existing shapefile basemap systems
- Support streaming processing for memory efficiency

### 4. Extensible Plugin Adapter Framework
- Enable plugins to contribute spatial features to the unified index
- Provide standardized interfaces for feature extraction and updates
- Support custom feature types and metadata from specialized plugins
- Handle plugin lifecycle events (load/unload/update)

## Quality and Conflict Management

- Implement data source prioritization based on accuracy, resolution, and recency
- Handle overlapping coverage from multiple sources
- Provide fallback mechanisms when preferred data sources are unavailable
- Support user configuration of data source preferences

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successful feature extraction from all major OpenCPN data sources
- [ ] Consistent feature representation across different source formats
- [ ] Efficient handling of large datasets without memory issues
- [ ] Proper conflict resolution when multiple sources cover the same area
- [ ] Extensible framework supporting future data formats and plugin contributions
