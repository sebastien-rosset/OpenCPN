# Maritime Spatial Index Implementation

## Project Overview

Implement a high-performance spatial indexing system for OpenCPN to enable fast navigation safety checks and constraint-based routing. This system will replace the current slow polygon intersection approach with an R-tree + distance field hybrid system that can handle complex maritime navigation requirements.

### High-Level Goals

**Primary Objective**: Enable efficient route finding that satisfies complex maritime safety constraints while maintaining compatibility with OpenCPN's existing spatial data systems.

**Core Capabilities**:

- **Multi-Constraint Route Planning**: Find routes that avoid land, maintain minimum depth clearances, respect traffic separation schemes, and adapt safety margins based on navigation context
- **Dynamic Safety Margins**: Support contextual safety requirements that change throughout a voyage, from precision harbor maneuvering to conservative open ocean navigation
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Unify spatial data from GSHHS, S-57/ENC charts, OSMSHP files, and plugin-provided sources into a single high-performance spatial index

**Contextual Navigation Safety**:
Navigation safety requirements vary dramatically throughout a voyage, and the spatial indexing system must support these varying contexts:

1. **Harbor/Marina Navigation (5-20m safety margins)**:
   - Close-quarters navigation through designated channels and fairways
   - Reduced but carefully calculated safety margins for necessary tight maneuvering
   - High precision requirements with frequent course adjustments
   - Integration with local chart features like berths, dolphins, and channel markers

2. **Coastal Navigation (20m-0.5nm safety margins)**:
   - Increased margins while still navigating defined channels and coastal routes
   - Balance between efficient routing and safety clearance from hazards
   - Navigation through narrow passages requiring context-appropriate reduced margins
   - Consideration of tidal effects and dynamic hazard conditions

3. **Open Water Navigation (0.5nm+ safety margins)**:
   - Maximum safety margins, especially in adverse conditions or night sailing
   - Liberal routing around potential hazards with conservative clearances
   - Substantially increased margins for overnight passages or reduced visibility conditions
   - Integration with weather routing for optimal long-distance planning

**Constraint Types**:

- **Hard Boundaries**: Physical obstacles that must never be crossed (land, shallow water below vessel draft, restricted areas)
    - Zero-tolerance proximity limits treated as absolute constraints
    - Examples: Coastlines, rocks, depth contours at critical draft levels, military zones
  
- **Soft Boundaries**: Features that influence routing preferences but allow flexible margins
    - Distance-based weighting factors rather than binary constraints  
    - Examples: Channel edges, recommended tracks, traffic separation schemes, preferred routes
    - User-configurable trade-offs between efficiency and conservative routing

**Voyage Phase Adaptation**:
The system will automatically adapt routing behavior based on voyage context:

- **Departure/Arrival Mode**: Recognizes marina/harbor environments and applies appropriate reduced safety margins for necessary close-quarters navigation while prioritizing channel adherence
- **Transit Mode**: Gradually increases safety margins as vessel moves to open water, maintaining broader clearance from all hazards while balancing efficiency
- **Night/Reduced Visibility Mode**: Automatically increases all safety margins, prioritizes well-defined channels and routes, and adds additional margin to navigational hazards

**Performance Requirements**:

- Achieve 10-100x performance improvement over current polygon intersection methods
- Support real-time constraint evaluation for interactive route planning
- Enable bulk safety checking for weather routing optimization
- Maintain low memory footprint suitable for resource-constrained marine systems
