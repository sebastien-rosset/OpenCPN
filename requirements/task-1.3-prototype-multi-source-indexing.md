# Task 1.3: Prototype Multi-Source Spatial Indexing

**Phase**: Foundation & Analysis  
**Dependencies**: Task 1.2

## Detailed Description

Create a working prototype that demonstrates unified spatial indexing across multiple data sources available in a typical OpenCPN installation, validating the abstraction design and performance benefits.

## Prototype Objectives

### 1. Multi-Source Integration Validation

- Demonstrate extraction and indexing of features from at least 2-3 different data sources (e.g., GSHHS + S-57 depth contours + OSMSHP coastlines)
- Validate that unified spatial queries can access features regardless of their original data source
- Test data source prioritization and conflict resolution (e.g., when multiple sources provide coastline data for the same area)
- Verify that the system gracefully handles missing or incomplete data sources

### 2. Performance Baseline Establishment

- Implement basic spatial indexing (simple R-tree or grid-based) for the multi-source feature set
- Measure query performance improvements over current source-specific implementations
- Establish memory usage baselines for the unified indexing approach
- Document load times for building spatial indices from available data sources

### 3. API Compatibility Demonstration

- Show that existing APIs (like `PlugIn_GSHHS_CrossesLand`) can be enhanced without breaking changes
- Prototype new spatial query capabilities that leverage the multi-source index
- Demonstrate backwards compatibility with existing plugin and chart system integrations

## Technical Approach

- Build incrementally on existing data loading mechanisms
- Reuse existing geometric types and coordinate systems where possible
- Focus on proving the concept rather than optimizing performance
- Create hooks for future enhancement without disrupting current functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successful integration of features from multiple data sources into unified spatial index
- [ ] Demonstrated query performance improvement over current implementations
- [ ] Validated backwards compatibility with existing APIs
- [ ] Proof of concept for extensible data source adapter framework
- [ ] Clear path forward for full implementation based on prototype learnings
