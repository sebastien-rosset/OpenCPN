# Task 3.1: Implement Distance Field Optimization System

**Phase**: Distance Field Implementation  
**Dependencies**: Task 2.1

## Detailed Description

Develop an advanced distance field system that provides ultra-fast spatial proximity queries for high-traffic maritime areas, complementing the spatial index for maximum performance in routing applications.

## Distance Field System Requirements

### 1. Adaptive Resolution Distance Fields
- Generate high-resolution distance fields for frequently queried areas
- Use variable resolution based on geographic complexity and query frequency
- Support multiple distance types (land, depth, hazards) in unified grid structure
- Implement efficient storage and compression for memory optimization

### 2. Smart Cache Management
- Automatically identify high-value areas for distance field pre-computation
- Implement predictive caching based on routing patterns and user behavior
- Support persistent caching across OpenCPN sessions
- Handle cache invalidation when underlying spatial data changes

### 3. Integration with Multi-Source Data
- Generate distance fields from any available spatial data source
- Combine information from multiple sources (e.g., GSHHS coastlines + ENC depth data)
- Handle data source priorities and conflict resolution in distance field generation
- Support incremental updates when new data sources become available

## Performance Optimization Goals

- Achieve microsecond-level query performance for cached areas
- Support efficient bulk queries for weather routing optimization
- Minimize memory usage through smart compression and quantization
- Enable background computation without impacting navigation performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Distance field queries show order-of-magnitude performance improvement
- [ ] Adaptive resolution provides appropriate detail for different geographic areas
- [ ] Cache management effectively identifies and pre-computes high-value areas
- [ ] Integration with all data sources maintains accuracy and consistency
